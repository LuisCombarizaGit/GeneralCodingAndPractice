Arrays in JavaScript are Objects. But is best to descrive them as
arrays due to the way the indexing works.

ArrayMethods: 

  Array.forEach().
  push()  adds to front.
  Array.isArray()  -----> checks if its an array becouse arrays are
  technically objects.
  shift() 

  Diff between Arrays and Objects:
     Arrays use numbered indexes
     Objects use named indexes
